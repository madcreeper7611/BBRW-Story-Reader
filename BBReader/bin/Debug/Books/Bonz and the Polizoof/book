        <page0>Bonzi And The \emp\\Map="Paullee zoof!"="Polizoof!"\</page0>
        <page1>It was a morning like no other! Spot sat high on the tree canopy watching three explorers leave the forest when he noticed one of them had dropped a small black box.</page1>
        <page2>Spot was excited, so he hopped down to Bonzi's hut to tell him about it! \Pit=400\\Spd=175\"Let's see what's in it!" \Pit=140\\Spd=150\said Spot. \Pit=50\"Maybe it's \emp\food," \Pit=140\said Bonzi. \Pit=400\\Spd=175\\Map="ummmmmm!!"=""Mmmmmmm,"\ like crunchy bugs!" \Pit=140\\Spd=150\Spot said in excitement! Bonzi picked up the strange box. At \emp\first he \emp\sniffed, then \emp\shook, then licked the box, but \emp\nothing happened. Then he found a bright red button!</page2>
        <page3>Bonzi pressed the button! There was a bright white flash that sent them both reeling back into the creek behind them. \Pit=50\"I see spots! Spot!" \Pit=140\said Bonzi laughing at himself! \Pit=400\\Spd=175\"What was that, Bonzi?" \Pit=140\\Spd=150\said a worried Spot.</page3>
        <page4>\Pit=50\"I think it's what people call a \Map="polaroo,"="po-la-roo,"\ \pau=100\a \Map="poleezoo,"="po-li-zoo,"\ ... a \Map="paullee zoof!"="po-li-zoof!"\ Look it's a picture of us!" \Pit=140\said Bonzi!</page4>
        <page5>\Pit=400\\Spd=175\"How fun! Let's go surprise everyone by taking their picture." \Pit=140\\Spd=150\Spot said clapping his hands, which always got stuck together. Being a tree frog he was always sticking to everything, but seemed to forget that, when he got excited! \Pit=50\"Come on Spot!" \Pit=140\Bonzi said, unsticking his hands, \Pit=50\"We've got places to go and pictures to take!"</page5>
        <page6>First stop was at Raffie's place. Bonzi and Spot climbed to the top of the highest branches where they knew Raffie would be having her mid-morning snack. "Smile!" They yelled, then flash!</page6>
        <page7>Raffie took off running before she realized it was Bonzi and Spot up to their old tricks again! \Pit=400\\Spd=175\"Very funny you two! At least you could have let me fix my bow!" \Pit=140\\Spd=150\After adjusting herself she decidedly said, \Pit=400\\Spd=175\"OK, I'm ready for my close up, Mr. Bonzi!" \Pit=140\\Spd=150\Of course Bonzi happily compiled and snapped a more flattering picture of their friend the giraffe. Then Bonzi and Spot asked her to join them and off they went to the water hole! There they would find Effie and hopefully Tuck too!</page7>
        <page8>Sure enough when they got there, Effie was showering herself with her long snout, and Tuck took benefit from it too, by standing close by.</page8>
        <page9>"Smile!", the three shouted giving no warning at all. Flash! Poor Effie was so taken aback she fell flat on her bottom smack in the middle of the waterhole, dousing everyone around her with a shower of water! Tuck on the other hand did what any smart turtle would do ... he tucked! ... right back into his protective shell! \Pit=125\"What! what! what on earth is that, Bonzi?" \Pit=140\said Effie shaking the water from her ears.</page9>
        <page10>\Pit=50\\"It's a \emp\polizoof. Look, here's a picture of you and Tuck!\" \Pit=140\said Bonzi \Pit=50\\"You guys look great!\" \Pit=140\he added. All the while Tuck, was trying to say something. \Pit=400\\Spd=175\\"What are you trying to say?\" \Pit=140\\Spd=150\said Spot, while still giggling from the whole water display.\Pit=50\\Spd=50\"I said, that's not a\Map="paullee zoof,"="polizoof,"\it's a Polaroid, a camera. I know, people like to take pictures of my handsome self."\Pit=140\\Spd=150\ said Tuck very simply, surprising them all!</page10>
        <page11>\Pit=50\\emp\"Oh well, yes, that's right, but I was close!" \Pit=140\said Bonzi! \Pit=400\\Spd=175\"I like \Map="paullee zoof"="polizoof"\ better," \Pit=140\\Spd=150\said Spot. \Pit=50\\Map=""paullee zoof,"=""Polizoof,"\ Polaroid, who cares! Let's go to the waterfall, get Tiggs and take a group picture!" \Pit=140\said Bonzi. Tuck climed onto Effies back and they all set out to find Tiggs who they knew would be near by the waterfall! When they got there, Tiggs was sound asleep.</page11>
        <page12>\Chr="Normal"\Whispering, Bonzi said \Pit=50\\Chr="Whisper"\"Ready everyone? On three. 1 - 2 - 3, \Chr="Normal"\\emp\surprise!!!" \Pit=140\They all yelled, then, flash!</page12>
        <page13>Nothing! Tiggs just rolled over and scratched his tummy. Then he slowly yawned. \Pit=100\"Oh, Hi! What are you guys doing here?" \Pit=140\he said. \Pit=50\"Obviously, not surprising you! Come \emp\on, we're going to take a group picture and we want you to join us!" \Pit=140\said Bonzi, already scouting out their location of the shot. \Pit=50\"There, over there, it's perfect! Right in front of the waterfall!"</page13>
        <page14>It wasn't very easy getting everyone to stand close together and balance on the slippery rocks, but there they were, looking radiant and smiling, and waiting for Bonzi's cue! Tuck had shown Bonzi where the self timer was, so he could join in the picture too! However, he told him he would have to set the timer and then run really fast to join in their pose!</page14>
        <page15>Then Bonzi said, \Pit=50\"OK! Ready everyone? On three ... \Map="1...."="1"\ - 2 ... \Map="Three!"="Threeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!""\ \Pit=140\and he \emp\jumped right into the middle of them, which made \emp\Raffie's foot slip, which bumped Effie, who shuffled and stammered, but took them all down into the pool at the base of the waterfall! Splash!</page15>
        <page16>\Pit=400\\"Woweeee! \Pit=50\That was \emp\great!\" \Pit=140\Bonzi said, as he hopped out of the water to grab the picture while the others laughed hysterically at themselves! \Pit=50\"Look everyone! I bet this is the best picture taken ever!" \Pit=140\Bonzi said, smiling at all his \Map="friends!.... The end!"="friends! THE END!"\</page16>
