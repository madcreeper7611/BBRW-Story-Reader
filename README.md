# BonziBUDDY Rewritten Story Reader
The source code for BonziBUDDY Rewritten's Story Reader. Once was coded on Visual Studio 2022 in C#, now coded in Visual Studio 2008 in Visual Basic. Please note that BonziBUDDY Rewritten is currently closed source, and will be released after it's finished updating.

The BonziBUDDY Rewritten Story Reader has no solution file (.SLN) of it's own because it's shares a solution with BonziBUDDY Rewritten, which is not ready to be put up for Open Source yet.
